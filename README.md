## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to layouting using display flex from the mobile view to desktop view, the project before [stats preview component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/stats-preview-card-component-d7ZkT4W2BQ), was using this similar approach to swap position with image, but instead using row or column, it used row-reverse to swap the order of the component.

CSS display flex for mobile view :

```css
main>section>div.card-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    max-width: calc(32.5rem / 2);
}
```

CSS display flex for desktop view :

```css
main>section>div.card-container {
        flex-direction: row;
        justify-content: center;
    }
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I will learn more and using more flex and grid in the future projects or even both, depending on the situation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Font Variations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variation-settings) - This helped me for importing font variation, i will used it forwards and if the font support font-variation.
